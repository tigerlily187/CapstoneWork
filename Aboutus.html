<h3>WHO WE ARE</h3>
<p>Those of us in the gun and knife industry, whether consumer or vendor, know that it is getting pretty ridiculus to view product and sell/buy what we want.
With all the red tape that the gun and knife industry has had to go through, there isn't a stress-free platform for products to be reviewed and purchased. 
This is where we come in....with a touch of all the social media platforms combined you can come in, take a look around, look a reviews and even purchase items you want.
Just abide by the rules set and your transaction should be simple and stress-free.<p>
